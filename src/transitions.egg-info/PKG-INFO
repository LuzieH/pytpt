Description: # transitions
        
        Implementation of Transition Path Theory for:
        - stationary Markov chains (transition_paths.py),
        - for periodically varying Markov chains (transition_paths_periodic.py),
        - for time-inhomogenous Markov chains over finite time intervals (transition_paths_finite.py).
        
        based on: 
        Helfmann, L., Ribera Borrell, E., SchÃ¼tte, C., & Koltai, P. (2020). Extending Transition Path Theory: Periodically-Driven and Finite-Time Dynamics. arXiv preprint arXiv:2002.07474.
        
        ## Quick Start
        1. Clone the project in a local repository:
        ```
        git clone https://github.com/LuzieH/transitions.git
        ```
        2. Create Virtual Environment (Optional):
        ```
        python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
        source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
        ```
        3. Install requirements with the Package Installer for Python3:
        ```
        pip install -r requirements
        ```
        4. Create folders to store npy files and plots: 
        ```
        mkdir tpt/data
        mkdir tpt/charts
        ```
        Rem: The above mentioned folders are ignored.
